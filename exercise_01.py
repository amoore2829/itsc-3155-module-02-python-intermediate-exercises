#Write a function that takes in a list data structure as input. 
#The function should create a new list and only include unique elements of the inputted list. 
#Under the function, write code that calls the function with a test list like so and print out the result. 
#Remember that your code should work for all lists of integers, not just the sample test here.

#Worked with Bishal, Sudamesh and Emre


my_list = [8, 77, 23, 4, 4, 8]
unique_list = list(set(my_list))
print(unique_list)
